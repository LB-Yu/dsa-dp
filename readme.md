This repo contains some template code of ***Data Structures and Algorithms*** and ***Design Patterns***. 

In my opinion, these two courses are different from other basic computer courses such as ***Operating Systems***, 
***Computer Networks***, and ***Principles of Computer Composition***. That is:
+ ***Data Structures and Algorithms*** and ***Design Patterns*** are directly related to our daily code writing.
+ ***Data Structures and Algorithms*** enable us to write efficient code - From a computer perspective.
+ ***Design Patterns*** enable us to write high-quality code - From a programmer's perspective.
